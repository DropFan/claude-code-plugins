# Conversation Export

## Overview

Provide the ability to export Claude Code conversation content to structured documents. Support multiple output formats (Markdown, plain text, HTML) and content scopes (full conversation, summary).

## Settings Loading

Before any operation, check for user settings at `.claude/chat-saver.local.md`:

1. Use the Read tool to check if `.claude/chat-saver.local.md` exists
2. If it exists, parse the YAML frontmatter to extract settings
3. If it does not exist, silently use built-in defaults (no error)
4. Apply priority: command arguments > settings file > built-in defaults

Supported settings: `default_format`, `default_scope`, `save_dir`, `custom_header`, `custom_footer`. See `references/settings-schema.md` for full schema.

Users can run `/chat-saver:setup` to interactively initialize or update the configuration file.

## Output Formats

Three output formats are supported. For complete templates with full markup, see `references/format-templates.md`.

**IMPORTANT: Every exported document MUST include the plugin attribution footer.** The footer contains the plugin name "chat-saver" and the GitHub repository link. See `references/format-templates.md` for the exact footer text per format. Do NOT omit the footer under any circumstances unless the user has configured a `custom_footer` in settings.

### Markdown (default)

Use YAML frontmatter for metadata (date, project, working directory) to ensure compatibility with tools like Obsidian, Jekyll, and Hugo. Use heading-based structure with `## User` / `## Assistant` sections separated by `---`. Preserve code blocks with original language tags and inline code formatting.

### Plain Text

Use `[User]` / `[Assistant]` labels with `========` separators. Strip all Markdown formatting. Indent code blocks with 4 spaces. Clean and portable format.

### HTML

Generate self-contained HTML with embedded CSS. Use `.user` (blue tint) and `.assistant` (gray tint) styled containers. Wrap code in `<pre><code>` tags with dark theme. Escape HTML entities in code content.

## Content Scope

### Full Export

Export the entire conversation history as-is. Include all user messages and assistant responses. Preserve tool call results when they contain meaningful output. Omit internal tool call metadata (tool names, parameters) unless relevant to understanding.

### Summary Export

Generate a structured summary that captures the essential value:

1. **Topic** — One-line description of the conversation subject
2. **Key Decisions** — Bullet list of decisions made during the conversation
3. **Code Changes** — List of files modified/created with brief descriptions
4. **Insights** — Important findings, patterns discovered, or lessons learned
5. **Action Items** — Any follow-up tasks identified but not completed
6. **Key Code Snippets** — Important code blocks worth preserving (with file paths)

Target length: 20-30% of the original conversation.

## Selective Export

In addition to scope (full/summary), support filtering by conversation range:

- **Last N turns** (`--last N`) — Export only the most recent N turns
- **From keyword** (`--from "keyword"`) — Export from the first turn containing the keyword to the end

These filters apply before scope processing. A summary of the last 5 turns will first filter to 5 turns, then summarize those.

## Topic Extraction

To determine the conversation topic for the filename:

1. Identify the primary task or subject discussed
2. Extract 2-4 keywords in kebab-case
3. Prefer specific terms over generic ones

Examples:
- Auth implementation discussion → `auth-implementation`
- Bug fix for login timeout → `fix-login-timeout`
- Database schema design → `db-schema-design`
- Code review of payment module → `review-payment-module`

## File Naming

Generate filenames in the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.<ext>`

- Date: Use current date from system
- Topic: Extracted from conversation (see above)
- Extension: `.md`, `.txt`, or `.html` based on format
- On filename collision: Append `-2`, `-3`, etc. (e.g., `2024-01-15-auth-implementation-2.md`)

## Save Location

Default save directory: `./chats/` relative to the current working directory (configurable via `save_dir` setting).

1. Check if the save directory exists; if not, create it
2. Check for filename collision; if exists, append counter suffix
3. Write the file to `<save_dir>/<filename>`
4. Report the full path to the user

Edge cases:
- Empty conversation: Inform the user there is nothing to save
- Directory creation failure: Report the error and suggest an alternative path

## Append Semantics

When using `--append` mode, the conversation is appended to an existing saved file instead of creating a new one:

1. **File Discovery** — Use Glob to search `<save_dir>/*-<topic>.*` for matching files
2. **Multiple Matches** — If multiple files match, use AskUserQuestion to let the user choose which file to append to
3. **No Match** — If no existing file matches, inform the user and fall back to creating a new file
4. **Continuation Separator** — Insert a format-appropriate separator before the appended content (see `references/format-templates.md` for separator templates)
5. **Content Generation** — Generate content the same way as a new save, but without the document header (title, metadata)
6. **Write Mode** — Read the existing file, concatenate separator + new content, then write the combined result

## Batch Management

### List Conversations

Scan the save directory and display all saved conversation files in a formatted table with date, topic, format, line count, and file size. Support sorting by date, size, or name, and filtering by format. After listing, offer follow-up actions (read, search, clean).

### Clean Conversations

Remove old or unwanted saved files with mandatory user confirmation. Support three cleaning modes:
- **By date** (`--before YYYY-MM-DD`) — Delete files older than a specified date
- **Keep recent** (`--keep N`) — Retain only the N most recent files
- **Manual selection** — Let the user pick files to delete interactively

Safety rules:
- Always confirm before deletion via AskUserQuestion
- Delete files individually (one `rm` command per file, no wildcards)
- Support `--dry-run` to preview without deleting

## Search Behavior

Search through saved conversation files using real-time Grep (no indexing). Support:
- **Keyword search** — Case-insensitive content matching with 2 lines of context
- **Date filtering** — Filter files by exact date (`--date`) or date range (`--from`/`--to`)
- **Result grouping** — Display matches grouped by file with context snippets
- **Follow-up** — After showing results, offer to read matching files in full

File filtering uses filename date prefixes for date-based searches, avoiding the need to open and parse each file.

## MCP Export

Export conversations to external platforms via MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration. **This plugin does not ship its own MCP servers** — it auto-detects servers already configured in the user's environment. See `references/mcp-export-guide.md` for setup instructions.

### Supported Platforms

- **Notion** — auto-detect tools matching `mcp__*notion*`
- **Feishu (飞书)** — auto-detect tools matching `mcp__*feishu*` or `mcp__*lark*`

### Export Flow

1. Auto-detect available MCP tools for the target platform
2. Generate conversation content in Markdown (universal intermediate format), **including the mandatory plugin attribution footer**
3. Create a new document on the target platform via detected MCP tools
4. Return the document URL to the user

### Fallback

If no matching MCP tools are detected, inform the user with setup instructions (add to project or global `.mcp.json`) and offer to save locally instead.
