If the conversation is trivial (simple questions, quick lookups, single-line fixes, or routine CRUD), approve stopping without comment. If the conversation contains a valuable, reusable pattern, block stopping and suggest: 'This conversation contains a pattern that could be reused. Consider extracting it with `/skill-extractor:extract` before ending. Type /skill-extractor:extract to extract, or just continue to exit.'"
